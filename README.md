# geo_dh

The repository includes key files necessary for the following two tasks:

1. Georeferencing: converting an image of a geographical map into a georectified data file that allows one to create digital geographical objects that can be later used for a variety of spatial visualizations. *Tools*: QGIS; *Data*: a scan of a printed map. 

2. Cartogramming: creating cartograms from geospatial data provided as a CSV file (table). *Tools*: R; *Data*: a version of geospatial data on the Greco-Roman world from Pleiades, a community-built gazetteer [http://pleiades.stoa.org/].

**NB** Necessary tools are available at:

- **QGIS**: http://www.qgis.org/ (check the QGIS Tutorial in the Georeferencing folder)
- **R** and **RStudio**: https://www.r-project.org/; https://www.rstudio.com/
